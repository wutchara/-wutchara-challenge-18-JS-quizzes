Set up an array of the following musical instruments:

cello
guitar
violin
double bass

Loop round and remove the vowels. Display the new words in a textbox, listbox or console.

Useful reference links: Again, loops and arrays. But also the Replace string method. Hint for this exercise: you can have one loop inside another.
